\description{
This dataset, cystic_fibrosis_snps_df, is a data frame containing genetic association data
for cystic fibrosis, including a case-control indicator and 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
with specified inter-marker distances. The dataset contains 186 observations across 24 variables.
}
\details{
The dataset name has been kept as 'cystic_fibrosis_snps_df' to avoid confusion with other datasets
in the R ecosystem. This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
DigestiveDataSets package and assists users in identifying its specific characteristics.
The suffix 'df' indicates that the dataset is a data frame. The original content has not been modified
in any way.
